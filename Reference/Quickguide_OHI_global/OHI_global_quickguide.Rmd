There are several steps to beginning a year's assessment.  Instructions provided below.

### Review and organize relevant issues
Review the github::issues and create a list linking to the particular issues that might be useful in the year to come.  This can include: 

* references/discussion that may lead to improvements to goal models, pressures or resilience
* new datasets that are worth exploring
* potential newimprovements to ohicore
* ideas for reorganizing/cleaning repos
* etc.  

Create a new issue that organizes and links to these issues.  This officially marks the start of the OHI assessment!

### Prepare the ohiprep repository
Create a copy of the most recent ohiprep repository and rename with the new assessment year.  I use the following steps to do this:


1. If you don't have the most recent year's repository, clone it to your local machine.  For example, if the last completed assessment was in 2018, you would clone the https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v2018.  Here is one approach using RStudio:

<br>
<br>
2. Navigate to https://github.com/OHI-Science and create a new repository:

<br>
<br>
Use the following parameters (but change the year in the repository name to match the current assessment year):

<br>
<br>
3. Copy the contents of the old ohiprep repository into the newly created repository.  Open the ohiprep_v20?? project in RStudio, and navigate to the Shell:
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Make sure that you are in the old ohiprep working directory. This is indicated by the:
`C:\Users\Melanie\github\ohiprep_v2018` 

If you are not in the correct working directory use the `cd` command to navigate there.  Type in the mirror command:

<br>
<br>
4. Navigate to the new repository on Github.com, https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v20??.git and make sure the folders/files are there.  Check that the default branch is "gh-pages" (and not the "master" branch).

<br>
<br>
5. Clone the new repo to your local system (instructions in step 1)

<br>
<br>
6. Delete the commit history of the new repository.  This gives us a clean slate to work from and keeps the repository from getting quite as big. I follow the general instructions from [here](https://gist.github.com/heiswayi/350e2afda8cece810c0f6116dadbe651).  Make sure you are in the working directory of the new repository, and in the shell type the following:


```

# Check out to a temporary branch:
git checkout --orphan TEMP_BRANCH

# Add all the files:
git add -A

# Commit the changes:
git commit -am "Initial commit"

# Delete the old branch:
git branch -D gh-pages

# Rename the temporary branch to master:
git branch -m gh-pages

# Finally, force update to our repository:
git push -f origin gh-pages

```
<br>

7. Navigate to the new repository on Github.com, https://github.com/OHI-Science/ohiprep_v20??.git and check whether there is only one commit.

<br>
8. Update README.md and delete unnecessary .Rproj files with the wrong year, commit, push.

<br>
<br>
9. You are done....go have a cup of tea!
