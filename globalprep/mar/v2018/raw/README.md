Mariculture Sustainability Index (Trujillo 2008)

Trujillo, P. (2008) Using a mariculture sustainability index to rank countries’   performance. p. 28-56 In: Alder, J. and Pauly, D. (eds.) A comparative assessment of biodiversity, fisheries and aquaculture in 53 countries’ Exclusive Economic Zones. Fisheries Centre Research Reports 16(7). Fisheries Centre, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada. 

## Notes:
I improved matching between FAO taxa and Trujillo taxa.  However, this level of change should be saved for OHI 2018.  Specifically, I made the "alias" list more complete, this field is used to identify a more general taxa that matches the Trujillo data.
