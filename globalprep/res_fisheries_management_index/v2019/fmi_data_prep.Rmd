# Summary
This document describes the steps for obtaining and wrangling the data used to calculate the fisheries management index resilience layer for the 2019 global assessment.

The following data are used:

* [Fisheries Management Index](https://oursharedseas.com/2019-update/fisheries/#highchart-fisheries-fmindex)

**Date retreived:** 12 July 2019

**Method:** Data are not accessible in csv format from website, so points were manually entered into excel and saved as a csv (found in v2019/raw)

# Updates from previous assessment
These data have not been updated since 2013
