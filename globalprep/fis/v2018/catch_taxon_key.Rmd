# Summary

Watson catch data (2018) doesn't have `TaxonKey` information like it did last year. Pull from last year's datasets.

```{r}

## Read in WAtson 2017 data from the impact acceleration project
watson_17 <- list.files(file.path(dir_M, "git-annex/impact_acceleration/stressors/comm_fish/int/catch_annual_data"), full.names = T)
## select 2014 catch data to grab TaxonKey information
taxonkey <- readRDS(watson_17[65]) %>% 
  dplyr::select(Taxonkey, TaxonName, CommonName)




## read in stock catch (tons) by region data
df <- read_csv(file.path(dir_M,'git-annex/globalprep/fis/v2018/int/stock_catch_by_rgn.csv'))

taxon_df <- df %>% 
  left_join(taxonkey, by = c("TaxonName","CommonName"))

head(taxon_df)

```
